# WhatsApp Web Responsive Overrides
Unfortunately, WhatsApp Web is a pain to use on my mobile phone. Well, as WhatsApp wants you to download their app for mobile users, they have no reason to optimize it.
However, as I am currently waiting for WhatsApp to support Android to iPhone chat transfers, I would love to use the WhatsApp Web feature on my iPhone...
For that reason, I created a simple override scripts for JS and CSS so that WhatsApp web becomes just a bit more user-friendly. Basically, it just displays either the list or one chat at a time.

It is far from perfect but feel free to use it (at your own risk) :)

It includes a minimized [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) version.

So I put WhatsApp Web to my Home screen. I am using a Safari Extension called Hyperweb to inject the JavaScript and CSS but I still have to manually disable/enable the desktop mode... You can see my custom extension config here (you should try to use a specific URL - but did not work for me sadly): https://extensions.insightbrowser.com/extend/e6f5150b57

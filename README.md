# WhatsApp Web Responsive Overrides
Unfortunately, WhatsApp Web is a pain to use on my mobile phone. Well, as WhatsApp wants you to download their app for mobile users, they have no reason to optimize it.
However, as I am currently waiting for WhatsApp to support Android to iPhone chat transfers, I would love to use the WhatsApp Web feature on my iPhone...
For that reason, I created a simple override scripts for js and css so that WhatsApp web becomes just a bit more user friendly.

It is far from perfect but feel free to use it (at your own risk) :)

It includes a minimized [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) version.
